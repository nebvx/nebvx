- Hi, I’m @nebvx and I am currently a university student in computer science. :) 
- First, main and basically only language I use is c++, just for the reason that I wanna be good in that before I expand.
- Advent of code is a little project of mine, that I do a little bit too late tbh, but wanna code for fun again and for that it's great.
